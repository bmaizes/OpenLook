> # Multi-Service Streaming Search App

This Angular application enables users to simultaneously search multiple streaming services for movies and shows using a single keyword. By integrating with streaming service APIs, users can input their owned streaming services and explore content across those platforms seamlessly.

## Features

- **Multi-Service Search**: Search for movies and shows across various streaming platforms simultaneously.
- **Service Filtering**: Select specific streaming services to include in your search.
- **Country Selection**: Choose your country to tailor search results based on regional availability.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through search results with options to load more or go back to previous results.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally and start exploring the functionalities:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the app.

## Usage

1. **Select Streaming Services**: Choose the streaming services you have subscriptions to by toggling the checkboxes in the Service Selection section.
2. **Choose Country**: Select your country from the dropdown list to ensure accurate regional availability.
3. **Enter Search Query**: Input your desired keyword in the search bar.
4. **View Results**: Browse through the search results displayed in the Results section.
